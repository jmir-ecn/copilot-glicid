# GLiCID Copilot

Welcome to the GLiCID Copilot repository! This repository contains the code for developing a copilot for the GLiCID supercomputing center to provide user support.

## Introduction

We are developing a copilot for the GLiCID supercomputing center to provide user support. To ensure its effectiveness, we need various types of data to assist users efficiently. Here are some types of data we are gathering:

1. **User Profiles**: Gather information about users, including their level of expertise, research interests, and any specific requirements they might have.

2. **FAQs and Knowledge Base**: Compile frequently asked questions (FAQs) and build a knowledge base containing information about common issues, troubleshooting steps, and best practices.

3. **User Interactions**: Collect data on past interactions between users and support staff, including inquiries, issues reported, and resolutions provided.

4. **System Status and Performance Data**: Monitor the status and performance metrics of the supercomputing system to detect any issues or anomalies that users might encounter.

5. **Documentation and Manuals**: Access comprehensive documentation and manuals related to the supercomputing environment, software tools, programming languages, and best practices.

6. **Training Materials**: Gather training materials, tutorials, and resources to help users improve their skills and make the most of the supercomputing resources available to them.

7. **Feedback and Surveys**: Solicit feedback from users through surveys or feedback forms to understand their experiences, preferences, and areas where they need assistance or improvement.

8. **User Preferences and Settings**: Capture user preferences, settings, and configurations to personalize the support experience and tailor recommendations accordingly.

9. **Community Forums and Discussion Boards**: Monitor community forums and discussion boards where users exchange ideas, ask questions, and seek assistance from their peers.

10. **Data Security and Privacy Policies**: Ensure compliance with data security and privacy policies when collecting and handling user data, and implement appropriate safeguards to protect sensitive information.

By leveraging these types of data, we aim to develop a robust copilot for the GLiCID supercomputing center that provides timely and accurate support to users, enhances their overall experience, and fosters a collaborative and productive research environment.
